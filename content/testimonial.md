# testimonial item
- name : "Byron Ruth "
  designation : "Director of Developer Relations, Synadia"

  content : "I interfaced with Rushabh on a semi-regular basis. The team he was on were active users of computational environment my team and I built for biomedical research. They were essentially dog-fooding this environment on behalf of the overarching program our teams were apart of. The basis reasoning was that if it didn't work for Rushabh and the team he was on, it likely wouldn't work for anyone else. Rushabh was very helpful in the early design and testing phases and provided thoughtful, constructive feedback as well as contributed code changes. He promoted the environment and help teach other researchers how to use it effectively. It was a pleasure to work with Rushabh and if our paths cross again, I would be delighted to work with him."

  content : "Rushabh Patel is far and away one of the most talented analysts and programmers I have had the pleasure of working with in my career. Not only does he have significant skills and training, he brings a curiosity, dedication to self-instruction, and ease with collaboration that is every bit as valuable, if not more than, his raw skills, extensive training, and meaningful accomplishments. He made me better at my job when I worked with him. He made my colleagues better. He made our organization function better. He left work with us which represents a first in my company's 125+ year history. Mr. Patel was a distinct pleasure to have as a colleague. I quickly learned that when he asked me for something he had already done extensive research into the problem on his own, I wouldn't be able to add to what he knew with a simple google search or by reading the relevant reference material. When I gave him advice, he took it. I can't tell you how rare that is. I never had to tell him something twice. Often after I did point him towards a solution he would circle back to me to explain what he found and offer more information he thought might help me that he came across in the process. When he moved on from our organization I was ambivalent. On the one hand, I was thrilled to see him get an opportunity he richly deserves, on the other I genuinely grieved the loss. Mr. Patel is a role model. I'm happy to know him."

Rushabh elevated our data science team with his positive energy, his computer science knowledge, and his 'nothing is impossible' approach to data science problems. Always eager to learn in what ways he can improve, Rushabh is the epitome of the 'Ideal Team Player' (as introduced in the book by Patrick Lencioni): humble, hungry, and smart. "

- name : "Oude Gao"
  designation : "Manager, Health Economics at VNS Health"

  content : "<div class='content'>Rushabh was a great colleague of mine and a valuable asset to the team at VNSNY.
        As a data scientist, he became the true pioneer and created brilliant solutions to roadblocks that we were not able to break through in the field of machine learning and predictive modeling in production. His knowledge from his master/PhD study helped me personally on questions I encountered in my work, as well as the way I think about the technical side of my tasks. He's a go-getter, a person that never lets you down, and a genuine friend. I truly believe he still has great potential unrealized and would recommend him as a great fit for a lead data scientist role.</div>"
